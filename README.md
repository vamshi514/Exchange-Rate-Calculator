# Exchange-Rate-Calculator
The Exchange Rate Calculator is a simple web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert one currency into another using real-time exchange rates fetched from a free API.

The interface is designed with HTML and styled using CSS to make it user-friendly. The main functionality is handled by JavaScript, which dynamically fetches exchange rates from an online API and performs the currency conversion based on user input.
